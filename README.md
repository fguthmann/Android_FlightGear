* In FG settings-> AdditionalSettings, write "--telnet=socket,in,10,127.0.0.1,6400,tcp".
* The telnet client can be running on the same machine as FlightGear itself, or on other machines that are in some way connected to the same network (LAN, WAN/internet).
* The IP given to the app shouldn't be 127.0.0.1 even if the app is running from the same machine as the FG.
* The port is 6400, if the port isnt available use different port (change it in the FG settings as well).
* (Developing is recommended in android studio using the emulator)
